Manage Work Orders
==================

Installing
++++++++++
The module is installed through Odoo's App interface. It will automatically install Odoo dependencies not already installed.

Setup
+++++
After installing the module, update the Settings in the Manufacturing module to "Manage production by work orders." This option can be found under Manufacturing Order > Routings & Planning.

Usage
+++++
Once a Manufacturing Order (MO) is created, you can create a Work Order (WO) and attach it to the MO. TO do so, in the Manufacturing module, go to Operations > Work Orders and click create. Under the Miscellaneous tab of the new WO, enter the MO you ant the work order to attach to, along with other information.

Alternatively, you can start by creating a WO, then on the Miscellaneous tab, create a new MO.

Once a manufacturing order has a work order attached to it, then a tab will show on the top of the MO, giving quick access to current and new work orders for that MO.
